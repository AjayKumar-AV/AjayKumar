## 🧠 About Me

With 2 years of experience in autonomous vehicle (AV) data annotation and QA, I specialize in labeling 2D/3D/4D data for advanced ML/DL models. I’ve worked on projects involving LiDAR, video, sequential labeling, path net validation, and traffic light QA using tools like **GTaaS**, **3D cuboid**, and **Polygon/Polyline techniques**.

My role has involved critical QA decisions, working with engineering teams, and maintaining annotation integrity under dynamic guidelines.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills

- **Labeling Types**: Bounding Box, Polygon, Polyline, Cuboid, Top-view Parking, Scene & Segment Labeling
- **Tools**: GTaaS, MS Office, LiDAR Annotation, Path Net, EGM, MSMFNET
- **Tech**: 2D/3D/4D Annotation, Coarse Validation, Traffic Light QA
- **Soft Skills**: Critical Thinking, Team Collaboration, Task Management, QA Reporting

## 🚀 Projects I Worked On

### ✅ Annotation Projects:
- Road Markings, Construction Objects, Ego Lane, Road Hazards
- Scene Labeling & Segment Labeling
- Sequential Labeling for 4D GT video data
- Top-View Parking (ParkNet) and Traffic Light Visibility QA

### 🔍 QA Projects:
- Validating annotations for ML model dashboards
- Identifying and resolving ambiguous labeling cases
- Peer-review and documentation of label decisions
